            <h2> Our Story </h2>
            <p> BakedbyAma, we are passionate about bringing you the finest homemade pastries, baked with love and care since 2012.<br>
                What started as a simple love for baking has blossomed into a business dedicated <br>
                to creating delightful treats that brighten your day.
                <br>
                <br>
                Our team of talented bakers, all self-taught, work tirelessly to perfect each pastry. From the very beginning, we've been driven by a shared desire to craft the most delicious, comforting,<br> 
                and high-quality pastries.<br> 
                We continuously improve our skills, experimenting with new techniques and ingredients to bring you fresh,<br> 
                innovative flavors while keeping the classic ones you love.<br>
                <br>
                <em>Every pastry we bake is made with the finest ingredients and a lot of heart.</em> <br>
                We believe that when you choose us, you're not just enjoying a treatâ€”you're experiencing the care and dedication we put into every batch.<br>
                <br>
